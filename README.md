# AdventOfCode2023
I figured I'd do different days in different languages this year...

So far I've got the following; more may or may not appear, as time allows!

## Day 1: Python
Prereqs: Python 3.10 installed

Build: Run `pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt`

Test: Run `pytest`

Run: Run `python __main__.py`

## Day 2: Javascript
Prereqs: Node installed

Build: Run `npm install`

Test: Run `npm run test`

Run: Run `npm run start`

## Day 3
Planned to be in Kotlin
